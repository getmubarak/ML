    "Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).\n",

    "1. Initialization\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "A set of k centroids are randomly initialized in the search space. These centroids must be in the same order of magnitude as the data patterns being clustered. In other words, it does not make sense to initialize random vectors with values between 0 and 1 if the values in the data patterns are between 0 to 100. To remedy this the data can be normalized between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assignment\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Once the centroids have been randomly initialized in the space, we iterate through each pattern in the data set and assign it to the closest centroid. Try and do this step in parallel, especially if you have a very large number of patterns in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Update\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "Once the patterns have been assigned to their centroids, the mean-shift heuristic is applied. This heuristic replaces each value in each centroid with the mean of that value over the patterns which have been assigned to that centroid. This shifts the centroid towards the high-dimensional mean of the patterns which belong to it. The problem with the mean-shift heuristic is that it is sensitive to outliers. To overcome this one can either use the K-medoids clustering algorithm or one can standardize the data to dampen the effect of outliers.\n",
